# ðŸš¢ Titanic Survivor Prediction Model

This project uses machine learning to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic based on historical data. It is built as part of a learning exercise and demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation techniques.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset used is the famous [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data) from Kaggle, containing information such as:
- Passenger class (Pclass)
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp (Number of siblings/spouses aboard)
- Parch (Number of parents/children aboard)
- Fare
- Embarked (Port of Embarkation)

## ðŸ§  Algorithms Used

This project tests and compares multiple machine learning algorithms, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)


## HOW to  run
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Animichael/Titanic_Survivor_Prediction_Model.git
